    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
  I came to <em>Canada</em> on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2023, with the goal of building a better
  future and improving my professional skills. Starting a new life in a different country
  was a big challenge, but it also helped me grow personally and academically. Studying at
  <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> has given me the opportunity to learn in a diverse
  environment and adapt to new cultures. This experience motivates me to work harder and
  stay focused on my goals.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports because it helps me stay active and
  motivated. I also like watching <em>American movies</em> to relax and improve my English.
  Visiting new places is very important to me because I like discovering new cultures,
  traditions, and ways of life. These activities help me learn, grow, and stay inspired.
    </p>
